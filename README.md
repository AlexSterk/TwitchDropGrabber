# Twitch Drop Grabber

Node.js application that watches Twitch streams ~~and collects [Drops](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/mission-based-drops?language=en_US)~~. 
When the stream it's watching goes offline, it finds a new one. Great for running in the background: **Set and forget**.

## READ THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT
Twitch has started to crack down on bots to farm drops. Therefore, as of right now, I've had to disable the claiming feature. 

Instead, when a drop is found, it will be logged to the console with a link, so you can manually claim it.

I'm not sure if this will be permanent or not. I will try to implement a fix as soon as one has been found. 
If you have any ideas, feel free to open a pull request.

## How to install/use

0. Ensure you have a working installations of Node.js, npm and Google Chrome
1. Clone the project
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the typescript files
4. Set up the [environment variables](#environment-variables)
5. Start the project with `npm start -- <GAME>` where the game is your game of choice that currently has active drop campaigns.
Replace `<GAME>` with the ID of the game in the Twitch directory. (e.g. ht<span>tps://</span>twitch.tv/directory/game/**fortnite**)
   
More options are available, you can see these using `npm start -- --help`
   
## Environment Variables

Two environment variables need to be set for this project. You can set these in whatever way you like. 
I prefer to use a `.env` file, see [.env.example](/.env.example) for an example.

The first variable you need to set are `TWITCH_AUTH_TOKEN`, which you can find by signing in to Twitch in your browser, and finding the auth-token cookie. 
Do NOT share this with others. This project will only run on your machine, and your auth token will therefore never leave your machine.

**NOTE: In light of the recent Twitch leaks, do remember to change your password. This also refreshes your auth token so if the tool stops working, you need to replace it with the new token!**

The second variable is `TWITCH_CHROME_EXECUTABLE`, which should point to your Chrome installation. 
Make sure this points to the actual application/executable file, and not just the install directory.
If this path contains spaces, you can wrap it in quote symbols (e.g. "path goes here").
A good way to find this path is to open Chrome, browse to `chrome://version/` and look under `Executable Path`

## Disclaimer

I really just made this tiny project for my benefit and don't intend to actively maintain/make changes to it. 
It works for me and suits my needs. 
I have no concrete plans to add new features or improvements, however you are free to open pull requests or issues, and I might look at them in my free time.

I might also have some improvements in other branches that I haven't fully tested for myself yet. So you can always try a more 'experimental' branch if something isn't working.

There are some things that would be nice to have though. 
I might add these myself in the future, but if you feel like it's a fun waste of time, be my guest:
* A better recovery for slow networks/networks failures
* A better way of checking if streams are playing.
* A way to detect channels you are watching going offline and hosting another channel
* A way to check the channel that is being watched did not switch to a different game
* An option to configure how many rewards you expect to claim (so the app can terminate once that is reached)
* A way to detect a faulty auth token and provide feedback
* ~~Watch a list of certain streamers instead of searching for a channel~~ âœ…

Feel free to suggest more.

This concludes what I've wanted to say. Maybe I forgot something, I don't know. Let me know by opening an issue. 

I hope this project helps you :)
